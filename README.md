### About Software Composition Analysis

As we all assemble more complex software apps from an ever growing number of
free and open source software components, knowing what's in our code is a must
for legal, security and operational reasons.

Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is the set of techniques to determine which
software components we reuse, where and how, as well as their origin, licensing,
vulnerabilities, quality and other important attributes.

Open source SCA tools are emerging as the best way to help determine which FOSS
software components are used in a software system or application. Their output
can be a software bill-of-material (SBOM).

You are an SCA FOSS tool or project contributor, maintainer, or user?

If so, let's meet at FOSDEM 2021 to share our techniques, experiences and bag of
tricks and demo or present our FOSS tools to colloborate towards a better SCA
FOSS toolchain.

### Call for Proposals

We are interested in all kinds of presentations about SCA-related topics using
Free and Open Source software. Some of the topics include in no particular order:

* OSS SCA tools producing a software bill-of-material:
  * Code origin detection techniques
  * Code matching and related code similarity detection
  * Static or dynamic binary analysis for provenance and origin
  * Source code analysis for provenance and origin
  * Package and project metadata collection
  * App and distro dependencies discovery
  * Container and related whole-distro analysis
* OSS SCA tools consuming a software bill-of-material:
  * License and copyright detection and analysis
  * Open data for SCA (packages, vulnerabilities, licenses, etc.)
  * Packages and projects quality metrics
  * Vulnerability detection and related security analysis
  * License and security compliance and policies
* Various data formats for SCA such as package manifests and SBOM
* New or existing **FOSS tool demo** for any of the above

### About the organizers

Last year we organized a fringe meeting on the day before FOSDEM 2020 and this
was well attended with over 50 participants.

We are seasoned open source developers that maintain a few popular SCA-related
tools and projects and want to ensure that all FOSS developers in that domain
can meet and share.

Looking forward to meet you,

the devroom organizers:

* Philippe Ombredanne, ScanCode and AboutCode maintainer
* Kate Stewart, SPDX and ACT @ Linux Foundation
* Michael C. Jaeger, FOSSology maintainer, SW360 ...
* Maximilian Huber, FOSSology maintainer and SW360 and LDBCollector

### How to Apply

All submissions must be made through FOSDEM pentabarf website. Make sure to
select the "Software Composition Analysis" when submitting:

https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM21

You must also make sure to be able to fulfil all requirements to be able to
present as listed in the next section.


### Prerequisites and Talk Details

* Since this is going to be a virtual event, we are planning to have
  presentations for about 10 minutes. You will have to pre-record this
  presentation ahead of time and upload it to FOSDEM servers.

* We are grouping three to four presentations on related topics into a session.
  Each of these ~10 minutes presentations will be broadcasted in sequence with
  a chat backchannel for questions from the attendees.
  Once the broadcast is completed there will be a **live** 15 minute panel with
  the presenters and moderated by the devroom organizers to address questions.

* Therefore the presenters must be online and available during the whole session
  that will air their presentation.

* With this approach we plan to support a combination of prepared presentations
  and interactive discussions which is alway a challenge for virtual events.

* Since presentations will be pre-recorded in advance and streamed by FOSDEM
  during the event, you will need to complete and submit your talk recording by
  mid January.


**International submitters:**

Please note that the event will run during European day hours CET time zone.
This is important because after your talk airs, you will have to attend the live
mini panel. We do not know yet the actual times slots we will have so please tell
us your home time zone in your submission so we can try to accomodate this as
best as we can.


### About FOSDEM

FOSDEM is a free, volunter-led and non-commercial event organized by the
community for the community.  The event in normally hosted at the Free
University of Brussels, Belgium. This year it will be held on-line for the first
time at the dates of 6th and 7th of February 2021. Participation and attendance
is free of charge. Please note that as in previous years the event can be
supported with donations and sponsorship. Although there is no registration,
attendees are expected to follow FOSDEM's code of conduct.

The goal is to provide free and open source software developers and communities
a place to meet. It helps to get in touch with other developers and projects.
It is an opportunity to be informed about the latest developments in the free
and open source software world.

Attendees can see interesting talks and presentations on various topics by
project leaders and committers; Last but not least, this event helps promoting
the development and benefits of free software and open source solutions.
