### Software Composition Analysis

After the Fringe event last FOSDEM 2020 about Open Compliance, which refers to open source tools for license compliance, this year’s edition of FOSDEM will feature a devroom on open source tools for software composition analysis (SCA).

Open source SCA tools help determine which software components are used in a software system or application. It is a good engineering practice to understand and control what is in your code and software stack: can you use it? what are the involved licenses? where does it come from? what's the origin of the software? is it known to be buggy or vulnerable? All of these are important questions to answer when using FOSS code and is what SCA is all about.

This understanding is crucial for several aspects of software development: 

* It helps to determine if vulnerabilities do apply or not to a certain code release. 
* The list of involved software components is required to determine the ruling license terms. And, the licensing for each of the involved components or even for every file needs to be  checked to ensure copyright and FOSS license compliance is respecting FOSS authors conditions.
* Software developers would like to keep current with possible updates to avoid using old,  outdated and possibly buggy or vulnerable releases. 

All these points represent important quality goals in software engineering. Today, SCA is therefore mandatory for every significant software development effort. Until some time ago, SCA tools were only available commercially. We now see the emergence of comprehensive FOSS tools that are best positioned to help the needs of free and open source software developers and the needs of free and open source software users.

The goal for this devroom is to bring together OSS projects and experts for showing how OSS projects improve SCA for their (OSS) software stack. The dev room targets developers and OSS project contributors for having insights and learnings about the current state of SCA.

### Call for Proposals

We're interested in all kinds of talks about SCA topics, of course! If you want to make your talk a bit more in-theme with the conference at large, take a peek at what FOSDEM published from previous years. Also, keep in mind, it's a conference centered around Open Source software. Topics include but are not limited to:

* SCA using dependency declarations and project metadata
* SCA by code origin detection
* SCA by binary analysis
* Data formats for SCA results or artefacts
* Particular aspects for OSS licensing questions and SCA
* SCA for vulnerabilities

### How to Apply

All submissions must be made through FOSDEM's pentabarf website. Make sure to select the "Software Composition Analysis" when submitting:

https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM21

You must also make sure to be able to fulfil all requirements to be able to present, as listed in the next section.

### Prerequisites and Talk Details

Since this is going to be a virtual event, we are planning to have presentations for about 10 minutes – pre recorded.
Then, three to four talks of the same topic area are combined into a session with a 15 minute panel session at the end – this is live and you will need to attend.
With this approach we plan to support a combination of prepared presentations and  interactive discussions even for a virtual event.
Presentations will be pre-recorded in advance and streamed by FOSDEM during the event. This means that you will need to complete and submit your talk by around mid January.

**International submitters:** please note that the conference will run during European day hours. This is important because after the talk airs, you will have to attend for the live mini panel. The SCA devroom will run for half a day on Sunday. We don't know yet the precise times.

### Questions?

### About FOSDEM

FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organized by the community for the community.  The event in normally hosted at the Free University of Brussels. This year it will be held on-line for the first time at the dates of 6th and 7th of February 2021. Participation and attendance is free of charge, please note that as in previous years, the event can be supported with donations and sponsorship. Although there is no registration, attendees are expected to follow FOSDEM's code of conduct.

The goal is to provide free and open source software developers and communities a place to meet. It helps to get in touch with other developers and projects. It is an opportunity to be informed about the latest developments in the free and open source software world.  Attendees can see interesting talks and presentations on various topics by project leaders and committers; Last but not least, this event helps promoting the development and benefits of free software and open source solutions.
